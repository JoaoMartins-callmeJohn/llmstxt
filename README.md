# üöÄ Getting Started with APS's LLMS.TXT and Cursor IDE

Welcome! This guide is for developers, citizen developers, and domain experts who want to **vibe code** Autodesk Platform Services (APS) APIs using the AI-powered [Cursor IDE](https://www.cursor.so/). With just a few steps, you‚Äôll be setup to generate and test real API code using plain-English prompts‚Äîpowered by APS + OpenAI + `llms.txt`.

## üß† What‚Äôs ‚ÄúVibe Coding‚Äù?

Vibe coding is the new way of working in AI-assisted IDEs. You don‚Äôt start with a blank file. You **talk to your editor**, describe what you want, and let it scaffold, correct, and enhance your code. It's part code generation, part pair programming, and 100% about speed, flow, and creativity.
